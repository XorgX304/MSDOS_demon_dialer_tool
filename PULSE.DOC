short documentation for PULSE

usage:
   pulse number

where number is a string consisting of
  0123456789  :  10, 1, 2, ... 9  pulses
  abcde-z     :  11, .... 37  pulses

first PULSE will put phone on hook,  then off hook,
 then pulse the number.


future:   - make timing adjustable, now pulsing is at almost the fastest
            rate possible where I live.
          - on/off hook optional
          - incorporate in demon program
