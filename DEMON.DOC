Short documentation for this demon dialer control program

usage:
  demon         : install on com1
  demon  u      : uninstalls
  demon  p2     : install on com2
  demon  t      : test if installed

DEMON installs itself in the background taking up about 1K of memory
it intercepts int09 (keyboard)  and int1c(timer)

******************* on/off hook switch ***************************

   Scroll lock toggles on/off hook

   A switch should be connected to the DTR line (D25:pin20  or D9:pin4)

******************* how to dial **********************************

position cursor to start of string, press numeric keypad '5'

x  -> play next char until release of '5'-key
  'x' can only deal with one character

0123456789*#  : as normal phone
 abcdefghijk  : shifted
 . or space   : end of string
 -            : ignored
 other        : extra pause

EXAMPLE :  (the '_' is for easy cursor moving in editor : ctrl-left/right)

j0 060220354 j5  _* _# c01231231231e

means go mode 0,  dial 060220354
go mode 5,  clearforward, seize, dial kp1+0+1231231231+st

j5  xf

means go mode 5,  play 2600Hz while key pressed

future expansions will be :
  - better timing facilities (now everything is based on the standard
    pc clock rate (about 55ms)
        - maybe timing specified by line below cursorline
        - define timing characteristics for unused characters
  - numberscanning : press shift+/-  or something and number under cursor
    will be incremented/decremented
  - popup window with setup for demon timetemplates/macro's
  - timescanning : easy increment/decrement of timing
    (So getting length of CF and Seize right will be easier)
