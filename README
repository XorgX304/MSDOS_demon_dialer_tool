demon   : background demondialer control program
tikken  : background cost pulse counter
pulse   : pulse dial program

These three fine programs written by ITSME, require special hardware to
function, without they are completely useless.

This special hardware consists of
   - a demon dialer, with rs232 interface
   - a cost pulse counter


they way I use DEMON:
  I enter some file with qedit, enter some of the numbers + mode switches
  I use most frequently hop around with cursor between them, .....
  in a second file / window I make notes of what I am dialing/scanning.

 with TIKKEN in the upper left corner of the screen it is easy to check
 whether your activities have been fruitful or not.

remark on PULSE :   pulsing an 'A' (11 pulses) is the same as dtmf 'A'
   (at least where I live it is)
