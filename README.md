# Demon dialer tools

The demon dialer was a blue-box, sold by [hacktic](https://hacktic.nl/magazine/1448.htm).

I wrote these tools to be able to dialing lots of phonenumbers relatively
quickly, while recording information about whatever answered. I used to do this
in order to find some way of accessing the early internet.

The idea was that the DEMON.COM program was sitting 'in the background', as a
TSR. and monitoring certain keypresses, while i was editting a textfile with
phonenumbers using 'qedit'.

When i pressed the right key, the DEMON TSR would pick up the phone, and
control the demon-dialer to make the call.
